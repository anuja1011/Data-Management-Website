# Data-Management-Website

This project focusses on the CRUD operation application in real-time. The idea is to develop a rewards tranfer system where employees can transfer points to other employees. 

The main pointers of this project are:
* Each Employee has two accounts - Giving and Receiving.
* The giving account refreshes every month-end making the balance to $0. The idea is that if the user is not utilizing his/her points it will be resetted at month-end.
* However the receiving account never refreshes. So user can keep on accumulating points.
* All these tranfer will consider all the edge cases.

Admin Account-
* View monthly transaction History
* View per user transaction History
* View the user not giving away his points
* All other reports related to transactions
* Reset accounts to zero balance

# The project is build using 

* J2EE Framework
* MVC architecture
* Oracle DB
* Apache Server
* JSP - HTML/CSS
